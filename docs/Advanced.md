# advanced tutorial

In this tutorial, we will expand upon the use-case we started in the [previous tutorial](tutorial.md). If you are unfamiliar with frof, or haven't read that tutorial yet, you may want to go back and read the [previous tutorial](tutorial.md) before continuing.

---

We will address a few new concepts in this tutorial:

- embedding frofs in other frofs
- handling concurrent jobs, and limiting how many jobs run at once
- a deeper understanding of how to use [variables](Variables.md)
